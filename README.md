## Description
On September 13, 2024 a body of a homicide victim was found. Crime scene analysis suggests odd similarities to series of 13 murders commited 13 years ago by unidentified serial killer (see case no. 20110913/013). We don't know if we're dealing with the same killer, copycat or it's just a coincidence. What we know is that killer won't stop on only one victim.

You take a role of a Police officer investigating a case of series of murders revolving around number 13. The killer is leaving clues about the next victim. Your objective is to identify the killer and protect their potential victims.

## Gameplay
On each day you can review police report and check personal files. You can protect a person from serial killer or arrest if you suspect them being a killer. You can arrest and protect only one person at once.
